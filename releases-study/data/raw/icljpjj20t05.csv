"Note: Jail jurisdictions are listed in order of their confined inmate population at midyear 2019. Data were estimated for jail jurisdictions that did not respond in 2019. Most jail jurisdictions consist of a single facility, but some have multiple facilities, or multiple facility operators, called reporting units (RU). If at least one RU responded, the jail jurisdiction is counted as a responding jail jurisdiction and data were estimated for the non-responding RU in that jail jurisdiction. For 2020, data were estimated for one RU in Marion County, IN, Davidson County, TN, and Franklin County, OH, that did not report on the number of confined inmates at midyear 2020, the number of inmates tested for COVID-19 and positive tests, or the number of staff that tested positive for COVID-19. Data were estimated for one RU in Sacramento County, CA, that did not report on the number of staff that tested positive for COVID-19. For 2019, data were estimated for one RU in El Paso County, TX, Gwinnett County, GA, and Milwaukee County, WI, that did not report on the number of confined inmates at midyear 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
/Not reported.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
:Not calculated because the numerator and denominator are not based on the same jail jurisdictions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a/Number of inmates confined on the last weekday in June.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b/Inmates may be tested more than once and may account for multiple positive tests.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c/Includes deputies, monitors, and other custody staff who spend more than 50% of their time with the incarcerated population, and administrators, clerical and maintenance staff, educational staff, professional and technical staff, and other unspecified staff who spend more than 50% of their time in the facility. Multiple positive results for the same employee were counted only once. The 2020 Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ) did not capture the number of staff who were tested for COVID-19, due to potential employee testing practices (i.e., tests conducted in jail versus employees who tested during their personal time).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d/Data were adjusted for survey and item non-response. See Methodology for non-response estimation procedures. Imputed values were used to calculate aggregate statistics but are not displayed for individual jail jurisdictions in this table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e/Did not respond or provide complete data to the 2020 ASJ.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f/Did not respond to the 2019 Census of Jails.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
